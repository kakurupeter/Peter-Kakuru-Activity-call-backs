# Peter-Kakuru-Activity-call-backs
The app is a simple two-activity Android application that allows you to display your personal information in the first activity and demonstrates various activity callbacks in the second activity. Here's a description of the features implemented in the app:

Main Activity:My  Personal Information

This activity displays my personal information, including my name, registration number, and my photo. You can customize the layout of this activity to include any additional information you wish to share. The activity serves as the entry point of the app, showing your personal details when launched.

MainActivity2: Activity Callbacks

This activity demonstrates four activity callbacks, which are methods called at different stages of the activity's lifecycle. The implemented callbacks could include methods like onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), and onPause(), but you can choose any other suitable callbacks. Each callback method is overridden in the activity and displays a Toast message indicating the current activity state. Toast messages provide brief notifications to the user, informing them about the activity's lifecycle events. Navigation between Activities.
